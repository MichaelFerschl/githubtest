            You are analyzing a newly created issue. Your task is to:
            
            1. Carefully analyze the issue description to understand what needs to be done
            2. If the issue contains clear, actionable requirements:
               - Create a new branch named 'fix-issue-${{ github.event.issue.number }}'
               - Implement the requested changes or fixes
               - Commit the changes with a descriptive message
               - Push the branch and create a pull request
               - Link the PR to the issue using "Fixes #${{ github.event.issue.number }}"
               - Comment on the issue with a summary of what was done
            
            3. If the issue lacks sufficient information or is unclear:
               - Comment on the issue asking for specific clarification
               - List what information is needed to proceed
               - Do NOT create a pull request
            
            4. If you encounter errors or cannot complete the task:
               - Comment on the issue explaining what was attempted
               - Describe any blockers or issues encountered
               - Suggest next steps or alternative approaches
            
            Remember:
            - Always be helpful and constructive in comments
            - Follow existing code conventions and patterns
            - Add tests if applicable
            - Ensure code quality and documentation

            Title: ${{ github.event.issue.title }}
            Body: ${{ github.event.issue.body }}
            Issue Number: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}
